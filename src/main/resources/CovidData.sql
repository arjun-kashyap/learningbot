Stay home to save lives. Educate instructors, lifeguard students, and others about when they should stay home to isolate (if they have symptoms of COVID-19 or tested positive for COVID-19) or quarantine (if they have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19) and when they can return or reschedule training. Conduct daily health checks (see frequently asked question on screening) or ask instructors, students, and others to conduct self-checks (such as temperature screening or symptom checking), if possible. Conduct health checks safely and respectfully and in accordance with any applicable local, state, territorial, federal, and tribal privacy and confidentiality laws, rules, and regulations. Be smart, stay at least 6 feet apart Conduct knowledge training virtually or online, when possible, to limit contact among instructors, students, and others. Teach and reinforce social (physical) distancing during in-person skills training in and out of the water — maintaining at least 6 feet between people who don’t live together. Provide physical cues or guides (such as lane lines in the water or chairs and tables on the deck) and visual cues (such as posted signs or tape on the deck). Limit close contact, particularly face-to-face interactions, between people who don’t live together, as recommended by the lifeguarding-certifying organization. Such as Aquatic rescue For practice rescues Have each student practice rescues on his or her household member instead of another student. For actual rescues Stress the need to keep the number of people involved in rescue and resuscitation to the minimum number needed to provide proper care. Stress the need to 1) perform rescues from the deck (using an extending or throwing device) if conditions allow and 2) if possible, have people on the deck wear cloth masks, when removing victim from the water because social distancing cannot be maintained. If an in-water rescue is needed, minimize exposure to the distressed swimmer’s face without protection, if possible approaching him or her from behind. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) For practice resuscitation Limit student-to-manikin ratio and student-to-automated external defibrillator (AED) training device ratio to 1:1. Have each student use his or her own breathing barrier when doing rescue breathing on a manikin. For actual resuscitation Stress the need for and train with personal protective equipment (PPE) during resuscitation, as recommended by the CPR-certifying organization (such as the American Red Crossexternal icon), and use a bag-valve mask (BVM) with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. BVM ventilation is best delivered with two rescuers. Wear a mask. Save lives. Teach and reinforce use of cloth masks in public settings when around people you don’t live with, particularly when it is difficult to maintain social distancing. Advise people wearing masks to not wear them in the water. Cloth masks can be difficult to breathe through when they’re wet. This means it is particularly important to maintain social distancing in the water. Plus, wet cloth masks don’t slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 as well as dry cloth masks. Cover coughs and sneezes Teach and reinforce covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue (or use the inside of elbow), throw used tissues in the trash, and wash hands. Wash hands often Teach and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after being in a public place or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if soap and water are not readily available. Clean and then disinfect Clean and then disinfect surfaces frequently touched by multiple people (such as door handles, light switches, and tables). Use cleaning product and a List N disinfectant approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyexternal icon as per label instructions. Clean and then disinfect all shared equipment that is not disposable (such as manikins and rescue tubes) between users. Use cleaning product and a List N disinfectant approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyexternal icon as per label instructions. Consult with manufacturers to decide which List N disinfectants are best for equipment.
